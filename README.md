# The Cake Study

## What:
A throwback website to host our case study materials for award entries. Inspired by: https://celeryman.alexmeub.com/

## Who:
The site traffic will be lower than an ecommerce site as itâ€™s just for judges to look at when reviewing award submissions. It will need to work in the US and overseas.
